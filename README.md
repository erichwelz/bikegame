gamblingbike
============

Originally based on Hackernest Construct's Hardware Hackathon.

An arduino was used to poll the speed of the bike initially via a magnet to attached to a hall effects sensor.

The pace of the bike ride was determined by how fast you were pedalling!

Refactored for web. Use arrow keys to control your speed.
